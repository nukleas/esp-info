# ESP32 Reference Website - Claude Code Prompts

This collection of prompts is designed to help you build a comprehensive, interactive ESP32 reference website using Claude Code (or Claude.ai).

## What This Project Is

An interactive web application that consolidates ESP32 documentation, pinout diagrams, variant comparisons, and common wiring examples into one easy-to-use resource. Think of it as a developer-friendly quick reference for working with ESP32 chips.

## Features

- 📌 **Interactive Pinout Diagrams** - Visual, clickable chip diagrams with detailed pin information
- 📊 **Variant Comparison** - Side-by-side specs for all ESP32 variants (ESP32, S2, S3, C3, C6, H2)
- 🔌 **Common Circuits** - Library of frequently used wiring examples with schematics
- 🔍 **Search Functionality** - Find pins by function across all variants
- 🎨 **Futuristic Design** - Minimalistic, cyberpunk-inspired UI
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** - Works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## How to Use These Prompts

### Option 1: Claude Code (Recommended)

1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) if you haven't already
2. Start with `00-implementation-guide.md` to understand the full scope
3. Follow the "Recommended Prompt Sequence" in that file
4. Copy each session's prompt and paste it into Claude Code
5. Review the generated code and iterate as needed

### Option 2: Claude.ai with Computer Use

1. Enable "Computer Use" in your Claude.ai conversation
2. Upload all markdown files to the conversation
3. Ask Claude to read `00-implementation-guide.md` and start with Session 1
4. Work through each session, letting Claude create files locally
5. Copy the generated project to your GitHub repo

### Option 3: Manual Reference

1. Use these docs as a specification for building manually
2. Each markdown file is self-contained and detailed
3. Follow the data structures and component descriptions
4. Implement features in the order suggested in `00-implementation-guide.md`

## Quick Start (Claude Code)

**Fastest way to get started:**

```
I want to build an ESP32 reference website. I have several 
markdown files with detailed specs. Let me upload them, then 
read 00-implementation-guide.md and let's start with Session 1 
to create the project foundation.
```

Then upload all 6 markdown files and let Claude Code take it from there!

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18+
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Graphics**: SVG (for diagrams)
- **Fonts**: JetBrains Mono, Inter (from Google Fonts)

No complex dependencies - keeps it lightweight and fast!

## Does This Need MCPs?

**Short answer: No**

The project can be built entirely without MCPs. However, these are helpful:

- **Web Search MCP** - For gathering accurate ESP32 specs during development
- **GitHub MCP** - For automated commits (though you can do this manually)

Everything else (UI, components, logic) can be generated by Claude Code natively.

## What You'll Need to Provide

Claude Code can generate the entire structure and UI, but you'll need to provide:

1. **Actual ESP32 Specifications**
   - Pin functions for each variant
   - Technical specs (CPU, memory, etc.)
   - These can be found on [Espressif's official site](https://www.espressif.com/)

2. **Circuit Schematics** (optional)
   - Can be created as SVG by Claude
   - Or you can provide images/diagrams

3. **Testing & Iteration**
   - Review generated code
   - Test on different devices
   - Provide feedback for improvements

## Expected Timeline

Following the implementation guide:

- **Phase 1-2** (Foundation & Home): 1-2 hours
- **Phase 3** (Comparison Table): 2-3 hours  
- **Phase 4** (Pinout Diagrams): 4-6 hours ⭐ Most complex
- **Phase 5** (Circuits Library): 3-4 hours
- **Phase 6-7** (Search & Polish): 3-4 hours

**Total: ~15-20 hours** of active development

But with Claude Code doing the heavy lifting, your actual hands-on time will be much less!

## Design Philosophy

This project emphasizes:

- **Performance** - No heavy animations, GPU-accelerated only
- **Usability** - Clean, intuitive interface
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard nav, screen reader support
- **Mobile-First** - Works great on phones
- **Developer-Friendly** - Built by devs, for devs

## Customization Ideas

Once the base is built, consider adding:

- User accounts (save favorite pins)
- Code generation (generate pin setup code)
- Community circuit submissions
- Multi-language support
- PDF export of pinouts
- Shopping cart integration (link to parts suppliers)

## Legal & Attribution

- **Link to official sources** (don't host Espressif PDFs directly)
- Credit Espressif for specifications
- Your UI/explanations are your IP
- Consider MIT/Apache license for the code
- See `00-implementation-guide.md` for more details

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude doesn't know ESP32 pin details"
➜ Provide the specs in your prompts or use web search during development

### "SVG diagrams look wonky"
➜ Iterate! Ask Claude to simplify or adjust specific elements

### "Mobile layout is cramped"
➜ Refer back to `02-design-system.md` responsive guidelines

### "Too slow on mobile"
➜ Check the performance section in `02-design-system.md` - ensure only transform/opacity animations

## Community & Contributions

Once you build this:

- Share it! The ESP32 community will love it
- Consider making it open source
- Accept community circuit contributions
- Link to it in ESP32 forums and subreddits

## Questions?

These prompts are comprehensive, but if you need clarification:

1. Check the `00-implementation-guide.md` file first
2. Each feature file (03-05) has detailed specs
3. Use Claude.ai to ask questions about any prompt
